# Preamp socket for WMA7RA-R5 (WanTcom)

## About us
This design has been made by the coil-lab of the High Field MRI Group of the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, where we make hardware to support our researchers. We are part of a research group which means we feel the need to open up some of our designs to whomever can make use of it, to further the research of MRI applications.


## The design
This project contains a socket for the WMA7RA-R5 and similar preamps made by WanTcom.

This socket makes it possible to quickly change the preamp in case of breakage, as well as easier repair than when they are soldered on larger boards.

The design and subsequent drawing has been done in Kicad 5.1.5.


## Download
Gerber and BOM production files for the latest _field tested_ version of the PCB can be found in the 'Releases' page, or by following [this link](https://github.com/umcu7tcoillab/Preamp_socket/releases/latest). 
You can also make your own production files by downloading the Kicad project and generating them, but these are not guaranteed to have been field tested.
